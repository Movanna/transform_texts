# transform_texts
**Python scripts for transforming texts from XML to HTML.**

I work with texts. Texts are often seen as uncomplicated: just characters, words and paragraphs in a text document. Everyone knows how to create a text, right? Just open Word and start writing. Then send the file to be published – and the fun begins.

Hardly surprising at this point, my view is that texts, textual phenomena, books and text formats are rather complex. A Word document can *look* just perfect, but still be a nightmare for someone who wants to publish the contents online. Wait, getting text from one place to another is as simple as anything, isn't it? Well, that's what developers always tell me: ”But, clearly, the text *is* all there!”. Yeah, it might be, but it still looks awful. If the result is that the subtitle is larger than the title, the text is cramped, the font is ugly, the italics you were expecting have disappeared, footnotes are gone, and the indentation is all off, then maybe that text wasn't such an easy prey after all.

Add to this TEI XML (the Text Encoding Initiative, https://tei-c.org/), where all kinds of textual features such as deletions, substitutions, underlining and language usage are meticulously recorded in tags and attributes. Let it simmer with web sites based on those source files. Stir in e-books, add seasoning from Transkribus (Handwritten Text Recognition, https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/), mix with desktop publishing, sprinkle with OCR, .odt and .docx and serve it all on a plate from the generic digital edition platform (https://github.com/slsfi/digital_edition_documentation/wiki). That dish can either grow your appetite for all things texty, or put you off completely. I'm still hungry, so here we go:

## 1. Transform XML
A common task for me is to convert a word processor document into the kind of XML this project uses. The starting point is to get collaborators to use styles in Word. If you provide everyone with a .dotx model document, where you have defined the styles you need, and some instructions, there's an actual chance you'll get neatly formatted Word documents back. Direct formatting instead of style usage will produce messy files (that still look great, but *only* in Word, not when you investigate the resulting code). I start off by converting the document to TEI XML using OxGarage Conversion (https://oxgarage.tei-c.org/). After that, I run transform_xml.py on it.

Another common scenario is to receive XML files exported from Transkribus. Transkribus is a great platform which is immensely useful to projects where manucripts (and even printed texts) have to be transcribed. But even though you can export as TEI, the XML is not the way this project wants ut, and there's a lot of Transkribus functionality, such as every line in the original image being connected to the corresponding line of text. This is great when inside the Transkribus UI, but not once exported, so I remove all of that with my script. This way editors can use Transkribus to get texts transcribed, and the continue to work on them efter the export without having to correct/change any of the code.

### 1. a) transform_xml.py

An XML to XML transformation using Beautiful Soup. Also a lot of string replacement with re and replace in order to firstly get rid of tabs, extra spaces and newlines, then add newlines as preferred and finally fix common text problems caused by OCR programs, editors or otherwise present in the source files.
